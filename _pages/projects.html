<h1>Simulation of Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
<h3>An analysis of robustness to random stopping</h3>
<p>Simulation designed for CMSC828X under Professor Lin Ming. This simulation is designed to evaluate two different vehicle following models, the method for which the motion of a car is determined in a microsimulation, respond to dynamic and unexpected obstacles. For this method I designed a modified version of IDM, Inteligent Driver Model, to simulate human drivers, and a modified version of CACC, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, to simulate automated vehicles. I then inserted obstacles into the simulation at runtime and evaluated the models in terms of number of collisions, mean traveling time and mean wait time. The paper for this article can be found <a href="/report.pdf">here</a>  and a small video clip of a standard run of this simulation can be found below. Note, the red vehicles are obstacles; the yellow vehicles are human driven cars and the yreen vehicles are automated vehicles.</p>
